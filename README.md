üåüPacManDemoJava

There still have many features that I havent finished it yet!, also not clean code...

This code is part of a Pac-Man style game implemented using Java Swing. It manages rendering and controlling characters: Pac-Man, Ghosts, and Cherry.

I created by 

1Ô∏è‚É£Initial Setup

‚û°Ô∏é rowCount, columnCount, tileSize: Define the grid size

‚û°Ô∏é map[]: Represents the map structure using characters

‚û°Ô∏é 'X' = wall

‚û°Ô∏é ' ' = empty/food

‚û°Ô∏é 'P' = Pac-Man starting point

‚û°Ô∏é 'b','o','p','r' = various ghost starting positions


2Ô∏è‚É£ Block Class

‚û°Ô∏é Represents movable/static game objects. Each Block has x/y position, dimensions, image, direction, and velocity.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Movement

‚û°Ô∏é Pac-Man: Controlled by keyboard input

‚û°Ô∏é Ghosts: Move automatically and randomly, only valid directions (non-wall)

‚û°Ô∏é Cherry: Moves randomly and slowly along food path

‚û°Ô∏é Function getValidDirs(Block b) returns valid directions for movement based on current grid and wall layout.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Collision Detection

‚û°Ô∏é Function collision(Block a, Block b) checks for overlaps:

‚û°Ô∏é Colliding with ghosts: lose a life

‚û°Ô∏é Colliding with cherry: gain score

5Ô∏è‚É£ Rendering

‚û°Ô∏é Handled in paintComponent(Graphics g), which draws:

Walls, food dots, Pac-Man, ghosts, cherry

‚û°Ô∏é Status text: score, lives, elapsed time
